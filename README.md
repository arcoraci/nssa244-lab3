# Lab 3 – Cloud Security with Azure Key Vault and Bastion

## Overview
In this lab, you will explore **cloud security best practices** by deploying and interacting with Azure resources using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

## Why This Repository Is Public
This repository is intentionally **public** and contains **starter infrastructure code only**.

In professional environments, it is common for:
- Infrastructure *definitions* (templates, schemas, baseline architectures) to be shared
- Environment-specific values and secrets to remain private
- Implementations and submissions to live in private repositories

This lab mirrors that real-world model.

⚠️ **This repository does not contain secrets, credentials, or solutions.**

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:

- A JSON Infrastructure-as-Code template used as the starting point for the lab
- Supporting documentation or reference material
- No submission artifacts

You will download and use these files as part of your lab work, but you will **not** submit changes back to this repository.
